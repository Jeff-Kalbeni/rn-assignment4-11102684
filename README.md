### My Job Seeking Application 
This is a simple application that allows a user to enter his name and email into a login form. The form takes him to another screen to explore a list of available jobs. In my App.js, I imported a "Login" screen which I created in a component folder. Attached to this description is a scrrenshot of the login screen.
